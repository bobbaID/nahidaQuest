                    <h1>Getting Started</h1><br>
                    <h2>Basic Introduction</h2>
                    <h3>nahidaQuest! is an incremental game based on the characters and world from the fantasy game Genshin Impact. 
                        It is developed by a solo developer, IAM_Sentry, who is also writing this wiki. 
                        <br><br>
                        I made this wiki with the intention of clarifying some mechanics as I realized some players (and testers) might benefit from such. 
                        Since I fully programmed the game, you can be rest assured that the information will be mostly* accurate.</h3><br>
                    <h2>Things to Note</h2>
                    <h3>nahidaQuest! is targeted for play in browsers. Making it an app for the Play Store and Google Play would be optimal for performace reasons. 
                        However, for legal reasons, I do not intend on getting copyright notices from Hoyoverse lawyers.</h3>
                </div>
                <div style="display: none;" class="text-block" id="text-block-2">
                    <h1>Characters</h1><br>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <h3>As of nahidaQuest! v2.0, there are currently <span id="charCount"></span> characters available to level and upgrade. 
                        <span id="normCount"></span> of these characters appear naturally by getting enough Nuts. 
                        <span id="wishCount"></span> of these characters (certain 5-Star characters) can only be purchased after Wishing for them using a special item. 
                        <br><br>
                        Nahida will always be available as the first character. Each character has an Element, Weapon and Nation. These affect the usage of certain items and currencies. 
                    </h3><br>

                    <h2>Cost & NpS</h2>
                    <h3>Characters start off with a Base NpS and a Base Cost. 
                        These follow the addition of a geometric progression formula based on the number of previous characters as well as the previous character's costs.
                        An example of the formula is shown below:<br><br>
                        
                        <div class="formula">Ex 1: For the 4th unlocked Character<br>
                        baseCost = 50 * (3 ** ((4 - 1) * 1.3)) + (3rd character's baseCost) * 6 <br>
                        baseNpS = (1.5 ** ((4 - 1) * 3.3)) + (3rd character's baseNpS) * 4.5 + (3rd character's baseCost) * 0.05
                        </div><br>
                        
                        <div class="formula">Ex 2: For the Nth unlocked Character<br>
                        baseCost = 50 * (3 ** ((N - 1) * 1.3)) + ((N - 1)th character's baseCost) * 6 <br>
                        baseNpS = (1.5 ** ((N - 1) * 3.3)) + ((N - 1)th character's baseNpS) * 4.5 + ((N - 1)th character's baseCost) * 0.05
                        </div><br>
                        
                        A character's base NpS can only be increased via Upgrading and Ascension. 
                        Item buffs (weapons, artifacts, etc.) do not affect base NpS in any way. 
                    </h3><br>

                    <h2>Levelling</h2>
                    <h3>Each level increases the cost of purchasing a subsequent level by 1.15. Thus, the cost of getting a certain level is simple to calculate.<br><br>

                        <div class="formula">Ex: <br>
                        newCost = baseCost * (1.15 * (No. Levels))</div><br>
                    </h3>

                    <h2>Upgrading</h2>
                    <h3>At certain level thresholds, characters unlock Upgrade opportunities. Upgrades increase the base NpS of a character.
                        Nahida's upgrades also include additional clicking damage for Expeditions. The formula for upgrade costs is as follows:<br><br>

                        <div class="formula">Ex:<br>
                        upgradeCost = (4 * baseCost * (1.15 ** (No. Levels - 1)))
                        </div><br>

                        Upgrades thresholds go up to Level 500, amounting to 13 upgrades. The first 3 upgrades cost only Nuts. 
                        Subsequent upgrades require Nuts + corresponding Talent Books or a corresponding Element Gem only.<br><br>

                    <h3>Using a special item called the 'Enchanted Courier', players can wish for exclusive 5-star characters. 
                        Wished characters use a different formula from standard characters - instead scaling to the player's current NpS as well as an additional wish factor.
                        <br><br>
                        The more wishes a player make, the greater the wish factor. Characters with internal IDs 800 and above are considered a Wish character.<br><br>

                                <br><br>
                                In Phase I, the Fellflower is capable of "Double Attacking" by itself. The first
                                ranged attack variant is introduced here - the "Rhythm" variant. Players have to click the circles at just the right time in order to pass. 
                                The Fellflower can also spawn "Drain Circles", which if not broken by clicking, drain health and energy. 
                                <br><br>
                                In Phase II, the Fellflower gains an unbreakable shield as indicated by its health bar changing color.
                                After rampaging for too long, the Fellflower becomes confused, triggering a "Aranara Rain" QTE.
                                Players deal damage in this phase by clicking the ice orbs while avoiding the spikes.
                                <br><br>
                                Additionally, its ranged attack becomes harder and it spawns "Drain Circles" more aggressively.

                                Additionally, the Fellflower's "Rhythm" ranged attack as well as "Drain Circles" can appear in Tree Defense and Skirmish battles. Finally, the second tier of Tree Seeds become available to collect.

                                The Unusual Hilichurl introduces a few mechanics that may seem unfamiliar such as its decoys in Phase I and summoning ability in Phase II.
                                <br><br>
                                In Phase I, the Unusual Hilichurl summons decoys of itself which all have a coordinated attack stance. However, only of one these attacks are real and can be parried.
                                Parrying the fake ones punishes the players instead. Additionally, the ranged attack introduces additional beat variants - 
                                Namely, the "Circle" beat which starts off slow but accelerates as well as the "Bullet" beat which starts off fast but has an indicator.
                                <br><br>
                                In Phase II, its decoys disappear but in exchange, the Unusual Hilichurl can summon other Mobs. 
                                It is recommended to quickly take down these mobs using the "Burst Attack" before the sheer number becomes overwhelming. 
                                Additionally, for ranged attacks, the third and final beat variant is introduced - the "Boomerang" which is fast initially but slows down after its rebound.

                            </h3>
                            <br>
                            <h3>
                                Technically speaking, the Shouko no Kami is the most unique boss in nahidaQuest!. Notably, most of its healthbar is within in Phase II, rather than Phase I.
                                <br><br>
                                In the relatively short Phase I, the base Shouko no Kami introduces its own "deflect" attack - After players counter, a QTE with a bar appears on the mob. 
                                By timing when the needle is in the dark areas of the bar, a "Strong Counter" is performed which decreases the time to attack of a mob more than usual. 
                                Missing the QTE, a "Weak Counter" is performed which decreases the time to attack of a mob less than usual. 
                                Additionally, a new ranged attack variant is introduced, where players have to avoid getting hit by the beat by navigating using the "Up" and "Down" buttons.
                                <br><br>
                                In Phase II, the Shouko no Kami's real form is revealed, with each of its four limbs having indepedent attacks. 
                                Its base gains a shield and the main way of dealing damage in this phase is to take down its limbs.
                                <br><br>
                                After some time, the Shouko no Kami can enter "Setsuna Shoumetsu" mode. 
                                In this mode, players must counter the attacks of its limbs as much as they can before the wind-up finishes. 
                                Failing to counter the limbs attack adds to the Shouko no Kami's burst attack, which is unleased all at once after the wind-up is done.
                                The burst attack also drains the player's energy so it is impossible to tank the subsequent damage if too many wind-up attacks fall through.

                                the most difficult challenge players face.
                                <br><br>
                                In Phase I, the Doctor has the ability to summon the Fellflower's "Drain Circles" as well as other minions. The Doctor and his minions have the ability 
                                to "guard" and "double attack".
                                The ranged attack in this phase is the regular variant.
                                <br><br>
                                In Phase II, the Doctor summons "Drain Circles" more frequently but stops summoning minions temporarily. The Doctor also gains the ability to "deflect" counters.
                                The ranged attack in this phase is the "Rhythm" variant.
                                <br><br>
                                In Phase III, the Doctor stops summoning "Drain Circles" but starts summoning minions again. This time, a final mechanic is introduced where it can "mark" its servants. If this servant is not defeated in time,
                                it gets "consumed" by the Doctor which regenerates its health.
                                The ranged attack in this phase is the "Spider" variant. Additionally, when brought down to 1HP, the Doctor initiates a long and difficult ranged attack
                                as its final attack. If players survive this final attack, the Doctor is defeated and the battle is over.

                    <h3>nahidaQuest! was built from scratch using vanilla Javascript, HTML & CSS. This encompasses all pages
                        that are on nahidaquest.com, which include the game, this wiki as well as the main landing page. To decrease
                        the size of the payload users need to download, practically all images served by this website is of '.webp' format,
                        which has generally smaller filesizes than 'png' and 'jpg'. This means IE is not supported (sorry
                        for the 0.1% of users stuck on that).
                        <br>
                        The only libraries that are being requested for the game are an Image Preloader and a "Panning and Zooming" library 
                        , both of which are loaded by a CDN. The website files are hosted on a static Github Pages server which is
                        rerouted through a Cloudflare DNS.
                        <br>
                        A significant portion of the assets were taken from the main game Genshin Impact or from GI web events.
                        Exclusive assets made for nahidaQuest!, such as cutscenes and UI, were made through edited 
                        in-game assets or made using Blender, a 3D computer graphics software tool set. To elaborate,
                        I used Festivity's shaders, which is freely available on Github.
